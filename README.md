## Questions about the Activity as you work. 
```
1. Why do we use classes in this instance? (because without them and just editing the for loop is less lines of code)
2. How would you use multiple classes in one class?
```
#### Description Of The App according to User Story
```
The app is about making a spiral by editing the main for loop given by PLTW. However, the twist to this project is that
you have to use a class in order to get the job done. My final code (Class117.py) uses a class to gather all of the
variables and objects. Using these classes, a for loop outside of function runs the program, which eventually draws
the spiral. The class has an init function which defines the variables using the self parameter, and then the string
function returns the data. To understand how to get to this point and use classes, I first had to go step-by-step
through PLTW with the different modifcations they provide. I edited these modifications in my old code (ForLoop117.py)
in the main for loop, which allowed me to understand how the code ran, how it worked, and details that I may have
missed. Overall, my code ended up working, and my final product with classes gave the result I wanted.
